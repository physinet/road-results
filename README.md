# BikeRank: skill ratings for amateur road cyclists

This is a **working draft** of an application created by [Brian Schaefer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briantschaefer/) for [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/) (Fall 2020 cohort).
This project will be finalized by **December 1, 2020**. Until then, please excuse any shortcomings.

BikeRank adopts the [TrueSkillâ„¢ Ranking System](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/) to [amateur road cycling races](https://results.bikereg.com/).
View this project online at: http://bike-rank.herokuapp.com/ (may take a few seconds on first load).
Here, you view ratings either by race or by racer.
Viewing by race, you can see how the ratings are updated as a result of each individual race.
Viewing by racer, you can see how each racer's rating changes over time.
